# junk-drawer  

**A chaotic collection of:**  
- **Spaghetti code** *(because sometimes it works and that's enough)*  
- **Ugly fixes** *(temporary solutions that outlived their temp status)*  
- *"Why did I even save this?"* **moments** *(we all have them)*  
- **Random experiments** *(90% trash, 10% accidental brilliance)*  
   **Scripts I might need again** *(but probably won’t)*  

## What’s in here?  
A mix of:  
- Half-baked prototypes  
- One-off automation hacks  
- Code snippets too useful to delete (but too niche to organize)  
- Things that made sense at 3 AM  

## Warning  
- **No guarantees** – some things barely work.  
- **No consistency** – different languages, styles, and levels of regret.  
- **No judgment** – if you see something bad, I probably know.  

## How to Use?  
1. `git clone` this mess.  
2. Dig through like a raccoon in a dumpster. 
3. Find something useful? Great!  
4. Find something terrible? Sorry (not sorry).  

## Why Does This Exist?  
Because sometimes **deleting code feels wrong**, even if it’s garbage.
